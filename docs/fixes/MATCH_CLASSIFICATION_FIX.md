# Match Classification & UI Improvements Documentation

## Issue Overview

The PUBG Tournament Tracker was incorrectly identifying match types (PUBLIC, RANKED, CUSTOM) using a heuristic-based approach that was prone to errors. With the discovery of the explicit `matchType` attribute in the PUBG API response, we've implemented a more reliable classification system.

## API Response Attributes for Match Classification

The PUBG API provides two key attributes in match data responses that can be used for accurate classification:

1. `matchType` - A string value with three possible states:
   - `"official"` → Public Match
   - `"competitive"` → Ranked Match 
   - `"custom"` → Custom Match

2. `isCustomMatch` - A boolean that is `true` for custom matches

## Match Classification Changes

### Backend Changes

1. **PubgApiService.js**:
   - Updated the `getMatchType()` method to prioritize the explicit `matchType` attribute
   - Enhanced `isRankedMatch()` to check for `matchType === 'competitive'`
   - Improved `isLikelyCustomMatch()` to check both `matchType === 'custom'` and `isCustomMatch === true`

2. **matches.js** (API Routes):
   - Updated the match classification logic in the `/api/matches/search` endpoint
   - Added debug logging for match type detection
   - Enhanced the match metadata returned to include accurate classification information

### Frontend Changes

1. **matchUtils.js** (New Utility File):
   - Created a new utility file with helper functions for match classification and display
   - Implemented `getMatchType()`, `getMatchTypeDescription()`, `getMatchTypeClass()`, and other formatting utilities

2. **MatchSearch.js**:
   - Updated to use the new utilities for match classification
   - Improved display logic to show the correct match type

3. **MatchDetails.js**:
   - Added match type display to the match info section
   - Updated to use the shared utilities for consistent formatting

## Testing Procedures

To verify the fix:

1. Search for matches using the PUBG API
2. Check the server logs for the detected match types
3. Verify that:
   - Matches with `matchType: "official"` are displayed as PUBLIC
   - Matches with `matchType: "competitive"` are displayed as RANKED
   - Matches with `matchType: "custom"` or `isCustomMatch: true` are displayed as CUSTOM

## Additional Notes

- Fall-back heuristic detection is still in place for handling edge cases or older API responses
- Debug logging has been enhanced to provide visibility into the match classification process
- Client-side utilities ensure consistent display and interpretation of match types

## Relative Time Display

We've also added relative time display throughout the application for better user experience:

- Matches now show "how long ago" they were played (e.g., "2 hours ago", "3 days ago")
- The exact date and time is still available as a tooltip when hovering over the relative time
- A new utility function `getRelativeTime()` handles the time conversion logic

### Implementation Details

- Added to matchUtils.js:
  - `getRelativeTime()` - Converts a date to a human-readable relative time string
- Updated UI components:
  - Match search results now show relative time instead of exact date
  - Match details page shows relative time with the exact timestamp available on hover

This improvement makes it easier for users to quickly understand how recent a match is without needing to interpret exact timestamps.

Version 1.0.1 of the server includes these fixes and improvements.
