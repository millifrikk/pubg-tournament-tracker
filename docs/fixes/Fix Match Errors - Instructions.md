# PUBG Tournament Tracker - Error Fix Instructions

## Issue Fixed:

1. **Match Search Error**: Fixed the ECONNRESET error when searching for matches
2. **Match Details Error**: Fixed the "getMatchDetails is not a function" error when viewing match details

## How to Apply the Fix:

### Step 1: Stop your server and client if they are running
Close any terminal windows running the server and client applications.

### Step 2: Run the server with the enhanced API service
```
cd server
node src/api/switchToEnhancedApiService.js --enhanced
npm start
```

### Step 3: Start the client in a new terminal
```
cd client
npm start
```

## What Was Fixed:

1. **Enhanced API Service**: Added better error handling, retry logic, and rate limiting to prevent ECONNRESET errors
2. **Missing Functions**: Added the `getMatchDetails` function to the enhanced matches service
3. **Improved Validation**: Added service validation to ensure all required functions are available

## Future Improvements:

To maintain a stable experience:

1. Use the enhanced search mode when searching for matches (toggle is available in the search UI)
2. Try to be more specific in your searches (e.g., recent time ranges, specific player names)
3. If you encounter any other issues, please report them

## Technical Details:

The enhanced service includes:
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Better error messages based on error types
- Cache integration for faster loading and fallback when the API is unavailable
- Robust timeout handling to prevent hanging requests

Enjoy your improved PUBG Tournament Tracker experience!
