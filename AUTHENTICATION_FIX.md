# PUBG Tournament Tracker - Authentication Fix Guide

This document provides instructions for properly fixing the authentication issues in the PUBG Tournament Tracker application. Rather than using temporary workarounds or bypassing authentication, we've implemented a comprehensive solution that addresses the root causes.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Authentication Bypass in Development Mode**
   - Removed the development mode bypass that was causing authentication issues
   - Properly implemented JWT verification for all protected routes

2. **Placeholder User IDs**
   - Eliminated placeholder UUIDs in tournament and team creation
   - Added proper validation to ensure valid user IDs are used

3. **Database Foreign Key Constraint Errors**
   - Added explicit `created_by` field to teams table to track ownership
   - Provided more detailed error handling for database constraint violations

4. **Client-Side Token Management**
   - Fixed token storage and retrieval in the client
   - Implemented proper error handling for token-related issues

## Implementation Details

### 1. Authentication Middleware

The authentication middleware (`auth.js`) has been updated to:
- Remove the development mode bypass
- Add better error logging and improved response messages
- Handle different types of JWT errors (expired, invalid format, etc.)
- Verify tokens consistently

### 2. Database Schema

The database schema has been updated to add the missing `created_by` field to the teams table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE teams ADD COLUMN created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id);
CREATE INDEX idx_teams_created_by ON teams(created_by);
```

A migration script has been provided to safely apply this change to existing databases.

### 3. API Routes

The tournament and team creation routes have been updated to:
- Extract user IDs from JWT tokens
- Validate user IDs before database operations
- Provide detailed error messages for constraint violations
- Track ownership of created resources

### 4. Client-Side Authentication

The client-side API service has been enhanced to:
- Dynamically fetch the latest token for each request
- Handle authentication errors consistently
- Provide detailed logging for debugging
- Safely redirect users when authentication fails

## How to Apply the Fix

1. **Update Server Files**
   - The key server files (`auth.js`, `tournaments.js`, `teams.js`) have been updated
   - Run the database migration to add the `created_by` field to teams table

2. **Run the Database Migration**

```bash
# First, make sure you have the latest code
git pull

# Apply the database schema changes
npm run db:fix

# Or alternatively:
npm run migrate:sql
```

3. **Testing the Fix**

After applying the changes:

1. Log out and log back in to get a fresh token
2. Try creating a new tournament
3. Try creating a new team
4. Verify that the created resources show up in your account

## Documentation

- The authentication flow is now properly documented in the codebase
- Error messages are more specific and helpful
- Foreign key relationships are properly maintained

## Future Considerations

- Consider implementing a token refresh mechanism to handle expired tokens
- Add comprehensive logging for authentication activities
- Create admin tools for user management

By implementing these fixes, we've addressed the authentication issues without resorting to temporary workarounds, ensuring a more robust and secure application.
