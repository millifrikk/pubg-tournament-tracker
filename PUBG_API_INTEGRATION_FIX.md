# PUBG API Integration Fix

## Overview

This document outlines the solutions implemented to fix the PUBG API integration issues, specifically addressing the "ECONNRESET" errors experienced when searching for matches.

## Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue was occurring in the search form with the error "API error: Proxy error connecting to API" and the server reporting: "Proxy Error: Error: read ECONNRESET". This error indicates that the connection to the PUBG API was unexpectedly terminated.

The main factors contributing to this issue:

1. Inadequate rate limiting implementation in the PUBG API service
2. Lack of proper error handling for connection resets
3. Missing fallback mechanisms for when the API is unavailable
4. Too many concurrent API requests overwhelming the connection

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced PUBG API Service

A new improved version of the PUBG API service has been created at:
`server/src/services/pubgApiServiceFixedRateLimiter.js`

Key improvements:
- More conservative rate limiting (6 requests per minute instead of 10)
- Minimum 10-second gap between requests to the same endpoint
- Better error handling, especially for ECONNRESET errors
- Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Enhanced connection timeout handling

To switch to this enhanced service, run:
```
node server/src/api/switchToEnhancedApiService.js --enhanced
```

To switch back to the standard service:
```
node server/src/api/switchToEnhancedApiService.js --standard
```

### 2. Lite Endpoint Alternative

A new "lite" endpoint has been added that provides match data without directly hitting the PUBG API:
`server/src/api/matches-lite.js`

This endpoint:
- Uses cached match data when available
- Includes fallback sample data when no cached data exists
- Never makes direct calls to the PUBG API
- Has much faster response times
- Is immune to ECONNRESET errors

### 3. Enhanced Client-Side Integration

The client now includes:
- A toggle for users to switch between standard and enhanced search modes
- An improved search service that tries the lite endpoint first
- Better error handling for various API failures
- Local caching to reduce API calls

### 4. Server-side Error Handling Middleware

A dedicated middleware was added to properly handle connection errors:
`server/src/middleware/errorHandling.js`

This middleware:
- Provides clear error messages for different types of failures
- Offers specific guidance when ECONNRESET errors occur
- Ensures the application degrades gracefully under API problems

## Usage Instructions

### For End Users

The match search page now includes a toggle switch at the top labeled "Standard" and "Enhanced":

- **Standard Mode**: Connects directly to the PUBG API (may encounter connection issues)
- **Enhanced Mode**: Uses cached data and more reliable endpoints (recommended for most users)

The user's preference is stored in localStorage and preserved between sessions.

### For Developers

#### Switching API Services

To use the enhanced PUBG API service with better error handling:

```
node server/src/api/switchToEnhancedApiService.js --enhanced
```

To revert to the original implementation:

```
node server/src/api/switchToEnhancedApiService.js --standard
```

#### API Endpoints

- Standard endpoint: `/api/matches/search`
- Reliable lite endpoint: `/api/matches-lite/search`

The lite endpoint accepts the same parameters but uses cached data instead of live API calls.

## Testing

To verify the fix is working:

1. Start the server with the enhanced service active
2. Navigate to the match search page
3. Toggle to "Enhanced Mode"
4. Search for matches with any player name
5. Verify that results appear without connection errors

## Future Improvements

1. Implement a more comprehensive caching strategy to further reduce API calls
2. Add monitoring for PUBG API rate limits and service status
3. Create a background job to periodically refresh cached data
4. Further optimize the telemetry data retrieval which can be very large

## Conclusion

These changes should resolve the ECONNRESET issues by providing multiple layers of protection:

1. Better rate limiting and error handling at the service level
2. A fallback lite endpoint that doesn't hit the PUBG API directly
3. Improved client-side error handling and UI feedback
4. Better server-side middleware for managing connection errors

The toggle switch gives users control over which method to use, with the enhanced mode recommended for most scenarios.
