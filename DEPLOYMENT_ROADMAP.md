# PUBG Tournament Tracker - Deployment Roadmap

This document outlines the step-by-step process for deploying the PUBG Tournament Tracker application to production, following the completion of testing and stabilization.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before beginning the deployment process, ensure the following items are completed:

- [ ] All critical bugs identified in testing have been resolved
- [ ] Real-time functionality has been verified with multiple concurrent users
- [ ] All environment variables are documented and prepared for production
- [ ] Database migration scripts have been tested and verified
- [ ] Security audit has been performed (authentication, authorization, input validation)
- [ ] Performance testing has been conducted under expected load
- [ ] API rate limiting strategies have been implemented and tested

## Deployment Architecture

### Infrastructure Components

1. **Web Application Servers**
   - Node.js Express application servers behind a load balancer
   - Auto-scaling group configuration based on CPU usage
   - Health check endpoints for load balancer monitoring

2. **Database**
   - PostgreSQL primary/replica configuration
   - Automated backups (daily)
   - Point-in-time recovery capability

3. **Caching Layer**
   - Redis for session storage and PUBG API response caching
   - Cluster configuration for high availability

4. **WebSocket Server**
   - Socket.IO servers with Redis adapter for horizontal scaling
   - Sticky sessions enabled at load balancer level

5. **Static Assets**
   - CDN for serving React application and static resources
   - Cache control headers for optimal performance

## Deployment Process

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Days 1-2)

1. **Set up production environment:**
   ```bash
   # Create production environment in cloud provider (AWS/Azure/GCP)
   # Create VPC, subnets, security groups
   # Set up load balancer with SSL termination
   ```

2. **Create database resources:**
   ```bash
   # Provision PostgreSQL database
   # Configure network security settings
   # Set up backup schedule
   ```

3. **Set up Redis cluster:**
   ```bash
   # Provision Redis cluster
   # Configure eviction policies and memory limits
   # Set up monitoring
   ```

### Phase 2: Application Deployment (Days 3-4)

1. **Configure CI/CD pipeline:**
   ```yaml
   # Example GitHub Actions workflow
   name: Deploy to Production
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
   jobs:
     build-and-deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Set up Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v1
           with:
             node-version: '16'
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: |
             cd server
             npm ci
             cd ../client
             npm ci
         - name: Build client
           run: |
             cd client
             npm run build
         # Additional deployment steps...
   ```

2. **Deploy database schema:**
   ```bash
   # Run database migrations
   cd server
   NODE_ENV=production npm run migrate
   ```

3. **Deploy application servers:**
   ```bash
   # Build and deploy server application
   # Configure environment variables
   # Start application with PM2 or similar process manager
   ```

4. **Deploy React front-end:**
   ```bash
   # Build React application
   cd client
   npm run build
   # Upload build artifacts to CDN or web server
   ```

### Phase 3: Post-Deployment Validation (Day 5)

1. **Smoke testing:**
   - Verify all critical paths are functioning
   - Test authentication flow
   - Test tournament creation and management
   - Test real-time updates

2. **Performance validation:**
   - Run load tests against production environment
   - Monitor response times and error rates
   - Verify auto-scaling triggers

3. **Security validation:**
   - Verify SSL/TLS configuration
   - Check CORS settings
   - Validate JWT token security

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Monitoring Setup

1. **Application monitoring:**
   - Set up APM (Application Performance Monitoring)
   - Configure custom metrics for important business processes
   - Set up alerting for critical failures

2. **Infrastructure monitoring:**
   - CPU, memory, disk usage alerts
   - Database performance monitoring
   - Redis monitoring

3. **Log management:**
   - Centralized logging solution
   - Log retention policy
   - Error alerting based on log patterns

### Maintenance Procedures

1. **Backup procedures:**
   ```bash
   # Verify daily database backups
   # Perform weekly backup restoration test
   ```

2. **Update strategy:**
   - Scheduled maintenance windows
   - Blue/green deployment strategy
   - Rollback procedures

3. **Scaling procedures:**
   - Horizontal scaling based on user growth
   - Database scaling strategy
   - Cache size adjustment procedures

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues, follow this rollback plan:

1. **Application rollback:**
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous application version
   cd deployment
   ./rollback.sh v1.0.0
   ```

2. **Database rollback:**
   ```bash
   # Revert database changes if necessary
   cd server
   NODE_ENV=production npm run migrate:rollback
   ```

3. **Communication plan:**
   - Notification to users about temporary service disruption
   - Status page updates
   - Post-incident report

## Long-term Considerations

1. **Feature flags:**
   - Implement feature flag system for safer deployments
   - Gradually roll out new features to subsets of users

2. **A/B testing:**
   - Set up infrastructure for testing new UI changes
   - Gather metrics on feature usage

3. **Analytics:**
   - Implement tracking for key user journeys
   - Set up dashboards for tournament engagement metrics

4. **Performance optimization:**
   - Regular performance audits
   - Database query optimization
   - Front-end bundle size analysis

This deployment roadmap provides a structured approach to taking the PUBG Tournament Tracker from development to production. Following these steps will ensure a smooth transition and set up the application for long-term success.
